Synopsis

Install package for fresh OS installs. Adds a number of my favorite useful applications for Mac OS. Includes things like Homebrew, Cask, git, tmux, nmap, the-unarchiver, textmate and more.

Motivation

Created this project so that I can easily install my favorite applications in one go after fresh OS installs.
